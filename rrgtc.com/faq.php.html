		The Red River Gorge Trail Crew is a volunteer group dedicated to providing access to the beautiful Red River Gorge through a well maintained trail system. They attend organized outings to improve the Gorge through clearing and maintaining trails.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question" id="when">
		<p><span class="lead_in">When does the group meet?</span><br>
		Outings are the second Saturday of every month unless otherwise noted. Project details are sent out as to the activities of the next outing via the mailing list. To join send a request via the <a href="join.php">Join page</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question" id="where">
		<p><span class="lead_in">Where does the group meet?</span><br>
		The specific meeting place is sent via the mailing list before every outing. To join the mailing list and receive more information about the outing send a request via the <a href="join.php">Join page</a>.<br><br>
		After the primary work outing, members are welcome to enjoy our volunteers-only campground for a potluck dinner and camp-over. The campground is well-maintained and well-equipped.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question" id="who">
		<p><span class="lead_in">Who attends the outings?</span><br>
		People from all walks of life attend Trail Crew outings, young and old, rich or poor, all sharing a common interest in having fun, working hard, and maintaining the Gorge. The Red River Gorge Trail Crew is full of interesting people and personalities and they are very welcoming to new members.</p>
